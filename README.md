# EPL-Score-Predictor
A score predictor app created on Java. This app was used to guess the scores during the English Premier League 2014 - 2015 season. Currently intending on updating so that it reads from the official EPL website, and can avoid being limited to only 2014-2015.
Another possibility is the implementation of machine-learning, and actual statistical calculations instead of number crunching.
